	Okay, I got sick of dealing with UTF-8 :-)
	I've got a proof-of-concept of a class-based String with a bunch of 
	operations. All data manipulation is character-based, you manipulate 
	unicode codepoints (characters) and don't worry about encodings.
	It's fairly slow at the moment, the proof-of-concept version stores 
	strings internally as dchar arrays, and it hasn't been optimised. 
	Barring any killer bugs, it should be usable anywhere that string 
	performance isn't a bottleneck.
	It's probably only useful to you if you're not entirely happy with d's 
	strings and/or arrays.
	I plan to do some optimisations and write a backend that uses UTF-8 
	(internally only), which should be faster (I hope).
	Interaction with libraries should be easy, char[]/wchar[]/dchar[] to 
	String is just String(data) (or String.valueOf(data)), String to the 
	array form is s.toUTF8/16/32().
	I'll write up a pretty-looking example sometime that isn't 3am ;-)

	Hi All!
	<p>

	A few months ago, I started working on a D front end for GCC.  I didn't 
	want to make any announcements until I was sure it was feasible.  Well,
	I finally got it working.  This first release is almost a complete 
	implementation -- the only major features missing are inline assembler 
	and volatile statements.  Supported systems are x86 Linux and MacOS X 
	with gcc 3.3 and 3.4.

	&gt;Would it be possible to write a OS / Kernel using D? I'm justing thinking<br>

	<p>

	Several weeks ago, I posted a link to one D based kernel I came across.  I don't
	believe it's on Digitalmars D language Links page so it's not easy to come
	across.  You have to search through the volumes of posts in this newsgroup to
	find it.

	<p>

	I haven't actually looked too much into this one, but the author seems to have a
	good base for an OS going (written using mostly D).
	<p>

	I think it would be great to have an OS with integrated garbage collection.  And
	D would be a great language to program it in.
	<p>

	Later,

Gentlemen, (Are there any ladies here?)

	I've successfully compiled the Mersenne Twister RNG in D.  In it's current
	state, it is simply a C program modified to compile in D. I would like to
	make it a true "D" program and would appreciate some suggestions on how to
	improve upon it! As pointed out by the original authors
	(<a href="http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/matumoto/emt.html">
	http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/matumoto/emt.html</a>),
	MT is "NOT SECURE for
	CRYPTOGRAPHY", I would like to remedy this situation and eventually provide
	an OO version of the RNG.

	Holy cow. I just downloaded the SWIG sources and I've been looking around at
	what it would take to write a SWIG extension for D. And this is the answer:
	<p>

	NOT VERY MUCH
	<p>

	In order to customize SWIG for any given language, there is only one source file
	that needs to be created. For Java, it's a file called "java.cxx" for C#, it's a
	file called "csharp.cxx". Each of these files is moderately complex. The java
	file, with all of the comments and newlines stripped out, is about 1400 lines of
	code (in C++). The csharp file is about 1600 lines.
	<p>

	That's not very much code.
	<p>

	Plus, I'm guessing that much of the code for the D extension would look an awful
	lot like the code for the Java and C# extensions, so we could borrow heavily
	from the existing implementation.
	<p>

	However, this project is not for the faint of heart. Even if it only requires
	writing 1500 or so lines of code, the author will have to have a pretty good
	command of C++ (I'm already out of the running) and an excellent understanding
	of D semantics (that eliminately most of us).
	<p>

	But, on the upside, once it's done we'll have access to millions of lines of C++
	code to use as imports and libraries for our own projects. I'm just giddy at the
	notion that we could suddenly have access to the entire wxWindows library, after
	writing only 1500 lines of code.


<hr><h4>9/18/03 Benji Smith <a href="http://www.digitalmars.com/drn-bin/wwwnews?D/17256">writes</a>:</h4>

	In article <bkcbf8r06@digitaldaemon.com>, Andy Friesen says...<br>
	&gt;wxWindows uses SWIG to generate all those other language bindings.  It<br>
	&gt;would probably be worthwhile to look into getting SWIG to make D<br>
	&gt;bindings as well.
	<p>

	I've just spent the last 20 minutes or so reading up about swig (
	<a href="http://www.swig.org">http://www.swig.org</a> ) and I'm impressed. Since there are already language
	bindings connecting C/C++ to Java, C#, Perl, Python, PHP, OCaml (and a few other
	languages), it shouldn't be too difficult to use those implementations as a
	reference for creating a D SWIG extension.
	<p>

	In my opinion, this is the most important project for D in the upcoming year.
	Because if we can assemble a general purpose method for creating bindings
	between C++ and D, we'll open up access to lots of existing libraries that we
	can't use now.
	<p>

	As soon as I've got the repository site up and running, this is one of the
	projects I'g going to create.

	The SynSoft.D libraries 1.2 are now available from
	<a href="http://synsoft.org/d.html">
	http://synsoft.org/d.html</a>
	<p>

	There are several new small housekeeping modules, along with the
	synsoft.win32.reg module that does registry stuff.
	<p>

	I've also changed the names of several methods in previous modules (I've
	decided to standardise on ThisKindOfMethodName, rather than
	this_kind_of_method_name()), but because of a linker weirdness  - it
	wouldn't link when there were start() and Start() methods in the same
	class - the deprecated functions with the old names have had to be removed.
	Apologies if this causes problems. ;/
	<p>

	The registry library, like the other ones, is a header-only from a
	source-perspective (i.e. the method bodies are stripped). This is not
	because I'm being precious, just that I only want any attention you may give
	on the module's API, not the implementation. Once this module is matured, it
	may be going into Phobos, at which point, obviously, all source will be
	available.
	<p>

	Note that the reg module only does enumeration for the moment. I've not yet
	decided on the format for adding/deleting keys/values, and am happy to hear
	some suggestions from anyone.
	<p>

	Alas, there are still no test programs, but I'm including my test program
	for the registry module here. Version 1.3 of the libraries will have test
	and sample progs, I promise.
	<p>

	(I've got to toddle off and do some other things - deadlines, deadlines -
	but I'll be keeping an eye on the ng, and will try to respond to
	feedback/questions/abuse. ;) )
	<p>

    Not through direct syntax.  You can synthesize one using a static member 
    and function.  You can also force memory recycling:

<pre class="d_code"><span class="notranslate"><span class="d_keyword">class</span> Singleton

    <span class="d_keyword">static</span> Singleton singleton;

    <span class="d_keyword">new</span> (<span class="d_keyword">uint</span> size)

	    singleton.init ();

    <span class="d_comment">/* This is used instead of a constructor to avoid having the

    <span class="d_keyword">void</span> init ()

Singleton a = <span class="d_keyword">new</span> Singleton (); <span class="d_comment">/* Create the new singleton. */</span>
Singleton b = <span class="d_keyword">new</span> Singleton (); <span class="d_comment">/* Recycle the old singleton. */</span>
</span></pre>

    Unfortunately one can't create a Singleton base class that would have 
    the inherited property, because "new" isn't passed the ClassInfo.
    <p>

    One might ask what I'm doing using "new void * [size / 4]" instead of 
    "new ubyte [size]".  Once the GC is type-aware, casting between an array 
    of values and an object reference will result in any pointers in the 
    object being collected.  I think I've advocated putting in casting 
    limitations to prevent the problem before, but in any case I am now; you 
    should not be able to cast between a value array and a pointer.

I may be missing something, but I haven't found any information in the D
documentation for how to declare associative array literal values all at once.

For example, once I've declared an array as:

char[char[]][] myArray;

I can now only add values to that array one at a time, as follows:

myArray["red"] = "ff0000";
myArray["green"] = "00ff00";
myArray["green"] = "0000ff";

What I'd like to be able to do (especially in cases where I have lots of values
to add to the array) would look something like this:

myArray = {

"red" =&gt; "ff0000",
"green" =&gt; "00ff00",
"blue" =&gt; "0000ff"

};

 ..or something like that. I don't really care about the {} braces or the =&gt;
 operator, but I would like something that lets me declare an associative array
 literal, just like I can declare a static array using the code:

int[] def = { 1, 2, 3 };

    Following up some recent debate in the Borland Delphi newsgroups about 
    this page [http://www.digitalmars.com/d/index.html] I would like to
    query a couple of items in the list.  (I expect you will get a message
    or two with Delphi's capabilities shortly <g>) 
    <p>

    i/ Huge play is made on the versatility of array type, which seems
    somewhat unfair to languages that explictly support the listed behaviour
    in their STANDARD libraries that are expected as part of a conforming
    implementation.
    <p>

    Specifically, C++ does not have 'resizable arrays' as a langauge
    feature because they are in the standard library, std::vector.  There is
    no likelihood any proposal to add such a feature to the language would
    ever pass committee because it is already required to be present (in the
    library) in any conforming C++ implementation.
    <p>

    While I can understand your desire to show your own product in the best
    possible light, I would like to at least see a 3rd option between 'yes'
    and 'no' for features implemented in the standard library of other
    languages (rather than 3rd party libraries, no matter how common)
    <p>

    Suggest a 'LIB' cell coloured yellow.
    <p>

    [otherwise such clear bias on something I do know well will give me
    doubts about other items I am less clear on, see below]
    <p>

    Under OOP you say C++ has module support.  News to me, this is one of
    the most requested extensions to the library and I still don't know
    anyone with a clear idea how to approach it!  I suggest you change this
    to 'No'
    <p>

    Also, Covariant return types is duplicated in OOP and functions
    sections, is that intentional?
    <p>

    Under reliablility I am very surprised that only 'D' rates as unit
    testable.  I would at least like a link to some material explaining why
    only 'D' qualifies here.  A good opportunity for a sales pitch if ever I
    saw one, this is the detail that caught my attention most!!  [Although I
    don't use Java, I was surprised that its extensive reflection API and
    unit-testing community did not qualify]
    <p>

    Again, a footnote explaining why C++ does not support all 'C' types
    would be useful.  Do you mean C99 here, or are there even more obvious
    cases I am missing?
    <p>

    I would be happy to see 'struct member alignment control' dropped from
    C++ (and presumably C) as this relies on common compiler extensions,
    rather than true features of the language itself.  If we are going to
    permit extensions, there are several popular C++ variants supporting
    delegates, but I would not suggest you add that to the list either <g>
    Rather, be stricter and say 'no' to struct layout control.
    <p>

    Last but not least, it would be really nice to turn the logic on the
    Macro Preprocessor.  The presence of this mis-feature is the cause of
    endless annoyance to C++, and its lack is certainly another score for
    'D'.

    Oh, and as a cheeky new feature you might want to add 'reference
    implementation available' given that I am not yet aware of a conforming
    C++ implementation [although EDG-based solutions are getting very close
    now]
    <p>

    Interesting chart though.  If you can find the people to contribute I
    would be interested in seeing how Eiffel, Python, Smalltalk and Haskell
    score as well.

    I have been trying to see how far one could go in creating source code
    documentation by mixing D and DHTML. The idea is to turn the source code
    into its own dynamic 'Table of Contents'.
    <p>

    You can see an example of this here:
    <a href="http://home.mindspring.com/~jonf4/d_docs/base.html">http://home.mindspring.com/~jonf4/d_docs/base.html</a>
    <p>

    As I am not a D programmer, I used one of Daniel Yukio Yokomiso's Deimos
    library files as an example.
    <p>

    So, is this a good idea ?
    <p>

    It seems like too much work to write the required HTML by hand. It ought to
    be possible to use the D parser to create a d2html program that uses the
    parse tree generate the HTML.
    <p>

    Any thoughts ?
